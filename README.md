**Logistic Regression Analysis**
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of various logistic regression techniques, including simple logistic regression, multiple logistic regression, ordered logistic regression, and multinomial logistic regression (MNLogit). The project aims to provide a practical understanding of these statistical methods and their applications in predicting categorical outcomes.

** Project Description **

The project focuses on analyzing student performance on math exams using demographic and academic factors. Multiple logistic regression models are developed to predict the likelihood of students scoring above or below a certain threshold on the math exam. The analysis incorporates variables such as gender, race, reading, writing, and social studies scores. Additionally, the project explores the application of ordered logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression for modeling ordinal and nominal categorical outcomes, respectively.

** Repository Structure **
